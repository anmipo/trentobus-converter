This utility parses the schedule files published on Trentino Trasporti website 
(http://ttesercizio.it), extracts the schedule data and saves the schedules
in a more manageable binary format.

The procedure:
1. In "res/pdf/schedule-pdfs-trento.txt" replace all entries of "T14E" with appropriate 
   year and season (Inverno/Estivo). E.g. "T17I" for 2017 winter schedules.
   The file contains brute-force paths to schedule PDFs for buses 1-17, A-D, NP.
   Add new entries if required (for funivia see below).
2. Download schedule files (
   "wget --random-wait -i schedule-pdfs-trento.txt"  (or whatever is the new file)
3. Download a free version of Foxit Reader from http://foxitsoftware.com.
4. Use Foxit Reader to save PDF schedules as TXT files (1 pdf -> 1 txt).
   Coverting 60+ files is rather boring and time-consuming, so open many PDFs
   simultaneously and let Ctrl-Shift-S be your friend.
   After conversion, move *.txt to "res/txt" folder.
5. Trento cablecar (funivia) timetable has a different PDF format, but luckily
   these data rarely change. So just manually update the dates in two files:
   "res/txt/OraridiDirettrice-*-T-zFVA.txt"
   Update the year in the file names and put them with the other TXT schedules.
5. Run ScheduleConverter: 
   "java -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -jar converter.jar input/path/to/txt/ output/path/to/dat/"
   IMPORTANT: The converter DOES NOT replace files in the output folder, it just
   adds new ones. So make sure the output folder is empty before conversion.
6. If there are any error messages, try to fix the offending .txt manually.
